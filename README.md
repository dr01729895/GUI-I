GUI I Fall 2020


This is a copy of my submission for homework number three on my public 
index.html file from the CS servers. The CSS file's raw text as well as the
finished homework will be hosted on:

http://www.cs.uml.edu/~druocco/WEB_INF/domenic_ruocco_hw4/index.html

Raw text:

http://www.cs.uml.edu/~druocco/WEB_INF/domenic_ruocco_hw4/style.css.txt

It can also be accessed by going to:

http://www.cs.uml.edu/~druocco/index.html

and navigating to the HW4 - Bootstrap

Note:
	Not much of the page is changed, mostly the table. Everything else was left the way it was.
  Inside the table the only css that is left over is the hover link color change, everything else is done through bootstrap
  I personally don't like going through Bootstrap because the color changes that it forces don't fit the rest of the site, 
  which has a very specific HEX value for each color. The website before Bootstrap was also very clean and simple to begin with, 
  and adding Bootstrap did not change this. Keeping the landing page neat is a preference for me, I like the clean look much better
  than if it were filled with clutter.
